# Scheme Editor (For Max/Msp)

  Scheme is the textual language that introduced me to programming.

â€‹	In 2019, [Iain Duncan](https://github.com/iainctduncan) released a Max external "S4M" which allow you to do some Scheme programming in the Max environment. 

I created this editor with the [codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) library. You can eval the block of code around the cursor by pressing Alt+Enter. 

[Here](https://guillaume-leo.github.io/schemeEditorForMax/) is a demo but you need Max/Msp and the S4M external to use it completely.
