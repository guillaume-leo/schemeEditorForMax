# Scheme Editor (For Max/Msp)

  Scheme is the textual language that introduced me to programming.

â€‹	In 2019, [Iain Duncan](https://github.com/iainctduncan) released a Max external "S4M" which allow you to do some Scheme programming in the Max environment. 

I created this editor with the [codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) library. You can eval the block of code around the cursor by pressing Ctrl+Enter. 

Here is the documentation on scheme ForMax:
